<h1 align="center">Full Stack App with React and a REST API.</h1>
<p>A client was created using React.js for my existing school database REST API (https://github.com/rrorrolfo/schoolDB_REST_API). This full stack application provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.</p>

<p>In addition, users are required to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.</p>

<h2 align="center">How it is built</h2>
-JSX and JavaScript was used to build out the components for the application in a modular fashion.<br>
-React Router was used to set up routes.<br>
-React Context was distributing state throughout the app.<br>
-Axios was used to fetch data from the REST API.<br>
-Users can sign up.<br>
-Basic Authentications is used to support users signing in.<br>
-Cross-Origin resource (CORS) sharing enabled for the REST API .<br>
